# Student Feedback System

## Motivation

The Student Feedback System is an automatic feedback generation system that provides the proper feedback to the teachers and the courses as per the categories like always, poor, usually, very often, sometimes. In the existing system, students can give feedback about the lecturers by doing manually.

The purpose of feedback in the assessment and learning process is to improve a student's performance. Students often use these portals to pick courses and create timetables.  It is essential that the process of providing feedback is a positive, or at least a neutral, learning experience for the student. We referenced some of the existing websites, such as “ratemyprofessor.com”.
